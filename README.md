🟣 AstrixChat

Real-Time, AI-Assisted Communication Platform

AstrixChat is a real-time messaging platform designed to remove language barriers and enable seamless global communication using WebSockets and AI-assisted translation.

The system focuses on low latency, high concurrency, and practical AI integration rather than demo-level features.

🚀 Key Features

💬 Real-Time Messaging with AI-Assisted Translation

Low-latency, bi-directional messaging using WebSockets (Socket.IO)

Messages are translated in real time between users speaking different languages

Each participant views messages in their preferred language

Original message context is preserved internally for accuracy

Optimized event-driven Node.js backend designed for high concurrency

🎙 Voice-to-Voice Translation

Users can send voice messages

Audio is processed, translated, and delivered back as voice output

Supports audio → text → translation → audio pipelines
